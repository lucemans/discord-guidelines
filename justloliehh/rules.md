# Server rules

Admins reserve the right to remove anyone from the server that is deemed detrimental at their discretion. Admin decisions and requests are to be respected at all times.

1. Racism, sexism, or discrimination of any sort will not be tolerated
Any such content - regardless of text chat, or over voice - will have the appropriate administrative actions taken. This includes offensive names and profile pictures.

2. Do not insult each other
We understand that things can get hectic and in the heat of the moment, tempers may flare and arguments can happen, but this does not mean we'll tolerate an argument only escalating due to direct insults being flung back and forth. Try to keep the atmosphere on the server enjoyable. If you can't resolve it - drop it and move on.

3. Do not spam text chat or voice
Spamming things over voice and disrupting other members' conversation, or clogging up text chat will be first warned for, then punished.

4. Do not recruit for your own server or advertise websites or streams on the server
Don't advertise for any non-affiliated Discord / Youtube / Instagram / TikTok etc. Don't advertise your stream, either. Any form of non-affiliated advertisement or promotion (including personal) will have action taken against it. This includes having a website as part of your nickname.

5. Please keep all form of gaming-related content in the appropriate channels. As well as any images in the #media channel.

6. All interactions with bots are to be done in the appropriate channel, please see #bot-spam .

7. Discussions regarding political topics are permitted as long as the conversation stays healthy. If a moderator deems a conversation as non-healthy debate, then the conversation is to be terminated.

8. NSFW (Not Safe For Work) Content, including but not limited to pornography, or any form of suggestive content are strictly prohibited. If you are unsure about the content you want to post, please contact a moderator.

9. If you have any issues or concerns please contact @helper or @moderator, and do not ping or DM anyone higher. Staff will take appropriate action on your request and elevate your concern if necessary.
